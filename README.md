# Payment method check

under construction

Check whether purchases in installments with interests charges are a better deal than buy in cash

The code should be refactored, as proof of concept I just wanted to make things work :) - besides, I'm not a frontend developer (I know, it should not be an excuse to poorly written code :)  

## It should consider
* Any investments you have and the return value per month (%)
* Value in cash
* Number of installments
* installment value

Still to be considered 
* inflation rate

 It its a better deal if we can keep the blue line above 0 during the entire period
